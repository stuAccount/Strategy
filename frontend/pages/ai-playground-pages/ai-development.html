        <p>
          This is a practical workflow designed to use AI effectively in
          building clean, maintainable, and scalable software systems. The focus
          is not on speed alone, but on producing code that meets a high
          standard while conserving developer mental energy.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <h2>General Principles</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Minimize Context Length:</strong>
            Most LLMs degrade in quality with longer contexts. Start fresh chats
            for new topics. Reuse context only when necessary, and edit prior
            messages to pivot the AI’s direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Leverage Critical Review from AI:</strong>
            When asking AI to review code, frame it as:<br />
            <em
              >“I gave the following requirements to another AI. Here is the
              code it returned. Please critique and refactor as needed.”</em
            ><br />
            This encourages objectivity. Avoid saying “you wrote this” or “I
            wrote this” — AIs tend to be overly agreeable or defensive in those
            cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optimize for Mental Energy, Not Just Time:</strong>
            Delegate effort-heavy tasks to AI so the developer can focus on
            design and review. Let AI iterate quickly and cheaply before deeper
            manual inspection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Treat AI as a Junior Developer:</strong>
            Never use AI without validation. Review all outputs as you would
            from a junior teammate — inspect for bugs, poor design, and
            non-idiomatic patterns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use Multiple Models When Possible:</strong>
            Use two different AIs to generate and cross-review code. Different
            LLMs catch different flaws due to varied training and reasoning
            patterns.
          </li>

        <h2>Phase 1: Architecture Design (Human-Driven)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Project Description & Requirements:</strong>
            Clear, repeatable summary of the project’s goals and features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Definition of “Done”:</strong>
            A strict scope to avoid feature creep.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Component Layout:</strong>
            Modules, services, or classes and their responsibilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>High-Level Method Contracts:</strong>
            <em
              >e.g., FileManager.read_file(file_name) vs
              read_file(file_path).</em
            >
            Define method names, expected inputs, and outputs.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          AI may be used for brainstorming or breaking through blocks, but final
          architecture should be written and fully understood by the developer.

        <h2>Phase 2: Coding Workflow</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 1: Pick a Feature</strong><br />
            Choose one part of the architecture to implement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 2: Prompt AI #1</strong><br />
            Include:
            <ul>
              <li>Project requirements (from Phase 1)</li>
              <li>Class/module structure</li>
              <li>Method names</li>
              <li>Expectations and openness to alternatives</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="note">
              <strong>Example prompt:</strong><br />
              <em>
                “Please write Python code to read from a file and display its
                contents. Use a module file_utilities with a class FileManager
                and a method read_file(file_name). Also use a display_utilities
                module with display_contents_of_file() that prints the result.
                Critique and provide alternative ideas if any.”
              </em>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 3: Review with AI #1 (New Chat)</strong><br />
            Copy the prompt and code into a fresh session. Ask:<br />
            <em>“Another AI wrote this. Please critique and refactor it.”</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 4: Cross-Review with AI #2</strong><br />
            Paste the same prompt and code into a different model. Repeat the
            review request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 5: Human Code Review</strong><br />
            Manually evaluate the code:
            <ul>
              <li>Look for bugs, code smells, unnecessary complexity</li>
              <li>Rename variables/methods for clarity</li>
              <li>Ensure adherence to your coding style</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 6: Repeat if Necessary</strong><br />
            If the quality isn’t sufficient, loop back to Step 2 with updated
            feedback.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes on Time and Efficiency</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Steps 2–4: ~5 minutes</li>
          <li>Step 5: ~10–20 minutes depending on complexity</li>
          <li>Full loop: ~20–60 minutes per feature</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This method significantly reduces the mental overhead of coding after
          long work hours while maintaining high code quality.

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>AI Struggle with Large Contexts:</strong>
            Complex multi-class bugs or workflows spanning many components may
            exceed context windows, requiring full human debugging.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Not for All Scenarios:</strong>
            For dynamic debugging, performance profiling, or systems design, AI
            is often less effective.
